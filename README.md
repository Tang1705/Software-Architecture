# Software-Architecture
According to the knowledge of software architecture, my teammates and I analyze the project named Camera. In the folder hand1, we discussed the data-oriented software architecture, DOA. In the folder hand2, we discussed the object-oriented principles are obeyed and violated in the project. In the folder hand3, we discussed the the software style of the project. The file in folder hand4 is my own work which is about the other project named reconstruction. The both projects can be found in my github. In the file, I introduced the project and analyze the design pattern used in  the project. All of them are written in latex and offered the pdf files.
